# Bluetooth RC Car

Use the Bluetooth detect script to connect to your desktop from the ESP controller

After pairing, you can connect like you would with headphones or a cellular device.

Load the ESP with the RC car script, then connect from your desktop bluetooth menu and run the Python script.

Note:  This is a PoC.  ESP controllers have a maximal amperage that is too low to run a DC motor.  If you are able to power a motor with the ESP, you will likely burn it in a few seconds.  To use this for a real RC car, upgrade to a more powerful controller.
